# DS HUD

## description

Just another one HUD.
I make it in my own purpose whatever it means is just mine business.

The main difference is that it integrated into a transparent screen (if you wish, sure you can use it on a basic screen :)) bc I like to pilot my ships from the cockpit. Thus it helps me to fly and I always test my product.

## installation
SImply copy **ds_hud_autoconf.conf** to your game folder under **Dual Universe\data\lua\autoconf\custom** <br/>
then RMB on your **control unit -> Advanced -> Run custom autoconfigure -> DS_HUD**

To use waypoint feature (if it supports) paste desired waypoint into the LUA chat
